<p>OpenStack is an open source counterpart to the software behind Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3, etc.). Since being started in 2010 by NASA and Rackspace Hosting, more than 150 companies have joined the project, including AMD, Intel, Canonical, SUSE Linux, Red Hat, Cisco, Dell, HP, IBM and Yahoo!. It is free open source software released under the terms of the Apache License.</p>

<p>Joel will be covering a technical view of OpenStack, demoing features and walking through the Python that powers them.  You can find out more about the project at http://www.openstack.org/.</p>

This talk is not intended to fully educate the audience on the use of the discussed functionality so much as make the audience aware of the advanced functionality Vim has to offer in order to have something to work towards.  Comfort with the basics of Vim would be useful but not required.</p>

<p>Some of the items planned on being discussed are:
- text-objects
- marks
- registers
- macros
- folding
- syntax highlighting
- mappings
- buffers/windows/tabs
- accessing remote files (scp://, ftp://, etc)
- running shell commands from within Vim
- the nuances of visual mode
- several cmdline commands such as :s and :g
- autocmds
- cmdline-window
- tags
- plugins
- diffs
- quickfix
- ins-completion
- basic vimscript
- automatic indentation</p>

<p>If there is anything else you would like, do not hesitate to ask about it.</p>

<p>This Thursday, 2012/10/18 at 7pm in Dreese Labs 266, The Ohio State Open Source Club will be presenting “What NOT to do with your F/OSS Operating System.”</p>

<p>This talk will be done a little more casual, with members sharing disaster stories of what they have done to their operating systems.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to participate, I just ask that you email me back with these three fields so that I may make you a slide:
- Operating System
- What broke
- Solution if there was one</p>

<p>also please have around 5 minutes of material to your story, if possible. As always, there will be pizza.</p>

Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as, but not limited to, programming), the benefits can far outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>In the past, Daniel’s presentations on Vim have attempted to provide benefit, for everyone from those completely new to Vim to more experienced users.  Instead, two talks on Vim will be given this time around: one for those who are new to Vim and another intended to benefit those already comfortable with Vim.  This first talk on October 11th will be solely an introduction; it will focus on the basics and be at a relatively slow pace.</p>

<p>Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux, as well as other platforms. If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install Vim and bring it in; playing with the various aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>
