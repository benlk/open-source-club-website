<content type="html" xml:base="opensource.osu.edu/open-source-club-website/announcements/2015/12/01/redis/">&lt;p&gt;This Thursday, December 3rd at 7PM in Caldwell 120, J3RN will be talking about Redis, the in-memory key-value store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redis is a nice (and fast!) alternative to using a database if the values you are trying to store are simple, and is commonly used for caching. The types that Redis natively supports are strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Additionally, Redis has other cool features such as a configurable level of on-disk persistence and “sentinels” for high availability. Redis is used widely by companies such as CoverMyMeds and was the persistence for the deceased IRC bot “spell,” and might be the perfect fit for your next project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The club systems will be undergoing scheduled maintenance this weekend, so expect downtime. Our sysadmin, William, will be reverting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gluster.org/&quot;&gt;Gluster&lt;/a&gt;. Also, We will be upgrading Stallman’s ram from 4GB ram to 12GB, in addition to replacing the power supply.&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone at sometime or another has relied on their browser to store sensitive credentials quite often due to sheer simplicity. Did you know up until 2013 Chromium was storing a user’s credentials in PlainText.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if your the type that likes to use a password manager, you might already be aware that not all services are created equal. Just this Summer LastPass’ security was breached, exposing email accounts, encrypted master passwords, and password hints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also discuss the lesser known solutions such as hardware encrypted HID devices. Just this year the Hack A Day community came together and designed/produced the Mooltipass, an open source hardware encrypted offline password manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to strike a comparable balance between convenience and security. The intention of this talk is to explore a wide variety of cross-platform solutions to secure your personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will talk about the different models of work flow, how source control plays a role, and then will talk extensively about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Git works. Following that, I will briefly cover how to use some basic Git commands and how to set it up quickly for the upcoming OHI/O 2015 hackathon. Plan on this meeting being slightly longer than usual as I want to ensure people will walk with a working knowledge of Git for the hackathon. Laptops are highly encouraged so you can follow along. A Github account is highly prefered as we will work on a live demo, time pertaining. As always there will be Pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

Licensing is a key part of the open source community, and your choices are diverse. We will talk about licenses ranging from the copyleft to the copyright, the unlicense to the Apache license. We will discuss how you choose your license for a project and what implications your choice has, and more importantly what a lack of choosing a license means and how it affects the Open Source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like every week, laptops are encouraged and there will be pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically I will be going over common network vulnerabilities and misconceptions. After a brief introduction, I will demonstrate how to brute force particular types of WiFi access points due to their inherently insecure “encryption”. I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intention of this talk is to educate members with respect to securing their own local networks. We are by no means responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. Performing said activities without the explicit permission of said owner is against the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
