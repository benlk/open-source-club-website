His blurb follows:</p>

<p>Basically I’m building an education platform with a few friends that heavily uses data analytics and A/B testing to allow teacher to iteratively improve their courses. Teachers or uses will be able to empirically test out educational psychology research and apply them into any course imaginable.</p>

<p>“Intellidu”: Our app is designed to make you learn the quickest possible in any subject.</p>

<p>Our app will let you learn up to 2x faster, by spacing your content for review at just the right time, be it Spanish flashcards or algebra exercises. This means you aren’t studying too much or too little. This is known as Spaced Repetition.</p>

<p>Anyone can create courses on our app. Likewise, through a process similar to Wikipedia, anyone can edit/ make suggestions to courses to make them better, following a set of standards developed from education research.</p>

<p>Course creators can optimize their courses through experiments. If Jim creates a Spanish course, he could assign a small portion of his users to a different version of his course, to see if that variation of the course makes students learn quicker.</p>

<p>We will host other features that make you learn as fast as possible, such as gamification (making learning like a video game) and course integration (you won’t have to be retaught the same content you learned in another course)</p>

<p>You will be able to study any subject on your computer or mobile device, for example chemistry through handwriting recognition on your tablet.</p>

<p>We plan to be FREE and open-source.</p>

<p>We plan to have a Beta Release of our minimum viable product this December</p>

<p>The KEY FEATURE is that we time how long it takes each user to learn each fact. This forms the foundation of our app, letting any developer or researcher come along to test if their teaching or studying method lets people learn quicker.</p>

<p>Initial project/”Minimum Viable Product”:</p>

<p>Simply a flashcard web app, that has a timer in the background tracking how long it takes you to learn each piece of information.</p>

<p>We’re going to be open source, and within a few months will be reaching out to people to join along. We are also going to register as a nonprofit.</p>

Description follows:</p>

<p>From the metaphorical ashes of the mostly-forgotten language Erlang, arises a promising successor, Elixir. With an intuitive syntax inherited from Ruby, Elixir takes the power of Erlang, and makes it accessible to even novice programmers. Elixir includes all of the most impressive features from it’s predecessor, such as the functional paradigm, hot-swapping of code, and fault-tolerance or the “let it crash” philosophy. In this talk, I will cover the basics of Elixir, including syntax and data structures, and a brief overview of Elixir’s build tool, Mix, as well as covering some of the philosophies that contributed to the formation of the language.</p>

<p>The year is 2014: home theater PCs are all but extinct… or are they? This talk will help you reinvigorate your media collection with a home media center, complete with intranet access and a killer frontend. We’ll cover some of the fun of Plex, XBMC, and MythTV. As a bonus, we’ll even show you what you can do with using a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>This Thursday, 2014-10-09 in Caldwell Labs 120, The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University will present Personal Projects.</p>

<p>This series of lightning talks will give an opportunity for members of The Open Source Club to show off the stuff that they’ve been making, whether at hackathons or in their spare time. Even class projects can be interesting.</p>

<p>The talk format is open to everyone, but if you want to 100% reserve space email meetings@opensource.osu.edu.</p>

Description follows.</p>

<p>Email has been the core of how we communicate via the internet for longer than some of us have been alive, but in modern times can involve a complex interaction between various systems to get your message from point A to point B. But it doesn’t have to be hard. I’ll be going over Zimbra, an open source mail and groupware solution that you can host and run yourself. With the right server and a domain name, you can take control of your email, calendar, contacts and files and have the convenience of “the cloud” without the PRISM.</p>

<p>I will be doing a live demo of setup during this meeting, and you can follow along if you have previous GNU/Linux experience. You’ll need a VPS with at least 2 GB of memory running Ubuntu 12.04 and a domain name set up and pointing to the box. You can download the necessary files ahead of time at http://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-collaboration-open-source</p>
