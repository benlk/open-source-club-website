These will not be overly in-depth as some of our past presentations have been; rather, these should just taste of what these Operating Systems are like or why people may be interested in learning more about them.</p>

<p>Additionally, we will plan out the topics for our meetings quarter. Bring ideas both for what you can present on, what you would like other people to present on, and topics for meetings which aren’t necessarily going to be structured as presentations.

Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (and the CLR, and JavaScript). It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.</p>

<p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.  When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.</p>

As is the general format, Alex will display and discuss major events in technology, with feedback from the audience. For the uninitiated, <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> (often abbreviated <strong>/.</strong>) is a nerd-oriented news website where the readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the front page, with a new page typically appearing every couple of hours. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article, by posting comments. These comments are then <a href="http://slashdot.org/moderation.shtml">moderated</a> by a randomly selected group of readers who can each add or subtract points from a limited number of comments for being funny/insightful/informative or offtopic/troll/flamebait, leaving only the highest rated comments immediately visible below the summary, often collectively making for a better read than the original article. Alex’s discussion will attempt to mimic this format, and provoke civilized (yeah right!) discussion and debate about news topics that matter to nerds.</p>

Regular Expressions is a system for pattern recognition in text which is extremely useful for text processing. This talk may be especially appealing to up-and-coming *nix admins, since such systems rely heavily on text for things like configuration, but should be useful for anyone interested in software. The talk will mostly use examples with the grep and sed utilities, which are almost certainly already installed on your Linux or OSX laptops if you’re bringing one along. If you’re bringing a Windows laptop, grabbing Windows versions of such utilities (or Cygwin, or Linux in a VM) may be useful if you want to play along, but shouldn’t be required to benefit from the talk.</p>

Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as Unix configuration, programming, etc) the benefits can far outweigh the cost. Daniel will cover Vim’s basic concepts and should get most who know nothing about Vim up to the point where they can use it. Additionally, Daniel will cover several more advanced concepts such as folding, q-macros, blockwise-visual tricks, and others. Feel free to come in with questions on anything Vim. Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux and others. If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install vim and bring it in; playing with the various aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>

Fanboys will often proclaim what they can do in a certain expensive proprietary image editor that shall not be named, so I’m going to demonstrate just the same things are do-able from another certain free, open source program. My claim is that <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> is <em>just</em> as capable of making your pictures lie as any other mainstream image manipulation software.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures. I also do not know the level of audience to expect, I don’t script or rehearse my presentations, and simply impressing you isn’t going to teach you anything. Therefore, the presentation shall be interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “what is a layer?” to as advanced as “how do I render lightning bolts?” or anything else you can think of. Comments are enabled, so you can post your ideas ahead of time.</p>
