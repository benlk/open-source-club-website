A short description follows:</p>

<p>I’ll be talking about the free and open-source relational database system PostgreSQL.  At gearDigital, the company I work for, we use it for our entire data infrastructure.  It closely adheres to the SQL standard, and is highly extensible, which gives it some interesting (and unique) capabilities.  I’ll detail some of the more interesting things you can do with Postgres during my talk - including using it as a search engine, as a GIS database, and as a social media client.  I’ll also cover some of the more advanced traditional features.</p>

The largest of the remaining tasks has been completed and we’re almost all set to go. Downtime will be scheduled this Friday starting at 3pm until I have no clue when as we do a final sync of the data, physically move the hardware, and verify that everything is operating correctly. Since stallman2 is a fresh start, it may not have all the software that stallman currently has. I’ll try to install some commonly used software, but if there’s something specific you want please email me at osler.6 to request it. Especially if you’d like a DE other than Unity or i3, since that’s all that’s installed so far. Please note that the new machine will be Ubuntu 14.04 (from 12.04) and will be 64 bit (from 32 bit).</p>

<p>Eli and I will be giving an introduction to web development using Ruby on Rails. Ruby is an open source programming language that first surfaced in the 90’s, and gained popularity through it’s expressive syntax and powerful features, such as metaprogramming. The Rails web development framework is written in Ruby, and is known for allowing developers to iterate extremely quickly. To illustrate this point, we intend to build a functional (though perhaps unstyled) blog in a fraction of the time it would take to write in another language or framework.</p>
