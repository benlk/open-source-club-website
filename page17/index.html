On Wednesday, April 20, at 6:30 PM in Lazenby 021, teams of students and faculty will be competing to answer computer science-related questions, perhaps with a few other topics occasionally mixed in. This time, people will be choosing their own teams. You can sign up your team in the CSE advising office on the third floor of Dreese.</p>

If you can answer yes to any of these and would like to know what else to avoid, or if you can’t and would like to keep it that way, please join us as various club members present how to break things! Everyone who has a story or a deadly command, please come and share it with us, no prior approval needed. Everyone else, prepare to be entertained.</p>

<p>As usual, we will be meeting on Thursday at 7PM in Dreese 264.</p>

<p>Go is an ancient board game (estimated to be 2000-4000 years old) which, despite a simple rule set, is extremely difficult to write a human-level AI for.  Unlike comparable board games such as Chess, the best Go AI’s in the world were not match against strong club players only a few years ago, and despite significant development recently they are still no match for weaker professional Go players today.</p>

<p>Daniel will be discussing why humans are so much better than computers at Go despite the simple rule set and two general approaches taken by open source Go AI developers.</p>

<p>The talk is intended to be interesting to seasoned Go players and AI hobbyists as well as those who know nothing about about the game or AI development.</p>

This talk is meant as a general overview of tools available as well as their practical applications in security audits and penetration testing. Tools and topics covered will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wireshark (protocol analyzer)</li>
  <li>Metasploit (penetration testing suite)</li>
  <li>Ettercap (multipurpose sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched LAN)</li>
  <li>Aircrack-ng (set of tools for testing wireless security)</li>
  <li>OpenVAS (open source replacement for Nessus, a vulnerability scanner)</li>
  <li>Nmap (swiss army port scanner)</li>
  <li>Password Crackers (John the Ripper, Ophcrack)</li>
  <li>Distros such as Backtrack, Knoppix STD, Damn Vulnerable Linux</li>
  <li>Kippo (simple honeypot with recording capabilities)</li>
  <li>A few hardening techniques and tools (mandatory access control, port knocking, intrusion detection tools, common sense things, old wive’s tales)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This talk is meant for educational purposes only. Techniques demonstrated should only be used on your own systems as using any of these techniques on systems that you do not own has a high probability of you ending up behind bars. These tools will be presented from the perspective of a security auditor and/or a systems administrator wishing to find weak spots in his or her own defenses.

This carefully considered decision was not made lightly, but we wish to honor some of our former members who now reside in Redmond, WA and set our political differences aside.</p>

<p>After much deliberation, out of respect for many of our former members, we in the Open Source Club administration have decided to partner with Microsoft. Despite our general hostility, and Microsoft’s apparent attitude toward our philosophy, Microsoft has always been friendly to the club. We in the Open Source Club have at times been <a href="/vista">hostile</a> towards the Microsoft club and their events, but have now come to realize what Visual Studio has to offer the community. As part of our partnership, all members are now encouraged to sign in with their Windows Live ID, using the link on the left. Additionally, our website search has been replaced with <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> Search. In return for this sponsorship, Microsoft will provide all Linux users willing to format their drives with a free copy of Windows 7 Home Basic (coming soon). Additionally, as part of our partnership, all registration information may be shared with Microsoft or its affiliates unless you <a href="/ntsig">opt out</a>.</p>

<h3 id="april-fools">APRIL FOOLS!!!</h3>

<p>We currently have no intention of partnering with Microsoft, and as far as we know the ntSig club remains inactive. This has been a well-meaning hoax by your webmaster. Furthermore, we will never share your information with anyone under any circumstances, per our <a href="/rules">terms of use</a>.</p>

<p>If you liked this April Fools’ Day joke, you can check out an example of another related website hoax <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a>.</p>

Dan Thau will show the window managers dwm and Openbox as well as LXDE which uses the latter. Mike Yanovich will demonstrate the Awesome window manager and Gnome desktop environment (version 2.x). Alek Rollyson will present Window Manager From Scratch. Alex Lingo will talk about KDE. Mike Bettencourt will introduce Gnome 3. Matt Meinwald will explain the XFCE desktop environment and Compiz.</p>

<p>Note that the order will likely be different than the one above. Hopefully by the end of the meeting, everyone will know enough about window managers to choose the one(s) that suit them best.</p>

If you have something you are working on, please comment below so I can get an idea of the time limits for these talks. If you don’t hear otherwise, assume they are five minutes each and a maximum of two talks per person. If anyone has a gong to help enforce these guidelines, please let me know. We need to do planning during this meeting as well, so please do your best to stay under time, and bring your meeting ideas.</p>

Dan Thau will explain ZSH, an extremely customizable and powerfull shell. Morgan Goose will present on Bash, a familiar one that still has some tricks up its sleeve. Michael Yanovich will demonstrate either ipython or bpython, a python-based shell. Matt Meinwald will show Fish, a friendlier shell. If anyone else has a shell to present, please feel free to talk for a few minutes on it. There are a lot of interesting shells out there, and it would be nice to learn about more.</p>

Next they will talk a little more in depth about how Android works from a software perspective (topics here include SDK, NDK, and getting it up and running on eclipse). Next they will explain the core objects (Resources, Activities, Threads and Processes) and interprocess communication (Content Providers, Broadcast Recievers, and Services). Finally there will be a little section on other cool up and coming techs related to Android Development.</p>
