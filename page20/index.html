<p>This meeting will mostly be aimed at preparing for autumn quarter, including scheduling as many of those meetings as possible, and deciding on our fall event. If time permits, it will also include a technical overview of our computer systems for future admins. This meeting is optional, but strongly encouraged for officers, and somewhat encouraged for people interested in presenting next quarter. If you want to give a presentation but cannot attend the meeting, just send an email to meetings@opensource.osu.edu with your meeting topic and availability to present, and we’ll put just as much effort into fitting you into the schedule as if you were able to attend. If you are available during the meeting time, but cannot be there in person, you can join us remotely by IRC (#osu_osc on freenode, check http://opensource.osu.edu/irc for details).</p>

Per our Free and open source philosophy, we will be promoting games that either run natively in Linux or run well in WINE and, while some of the games themselves might not be free or open source in nature, we would like to show how gaming in Linux is not a lost cause. We will be providing a venue for people to come out and play the following computer games:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quake 3</li>
  <li>Quake Live</li>
  <li>Starcraft and Starcraft:Brood War</li>
  <li>Any game that runs natively in Linux (one of us will surely play and we are always looking for good F/OSS games)</li>
  <li>If you’re not sure whether a game runs in WINE or natively on Linux, bring it out and we will investigate together!</li>
</ul>

<p><u>**We will be providing pizza around lunch and dinner times as well as limited amounts of soft drinks (Coke products of course).**</u> This is an open event so anyone and everyone are welcome, including users of all operating systems of course (these games run just fine in Windows), we are just trying to show how Linux users are not stuck when it comes to gaming. Even if you have never played any of these games, but just like gaming, come on out and we will show you the ropes! We will be posting more information about the LAN party as time draws closer and you will be able to find and receive up-to-date information in the following two ways: The LAN Party wiki: http://opensource.osu.edu/lan And/Or you can join our announcement list to get information as it is released: http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce The LAN Party is tentatively being held in the Ohio Union Creative Arts room but this is subject to change, you will be able to get up-to-date information through the channels listed above. The games list is also subject to change as we get suggestions or come up with more ideas. If you have any questions you can send an email to lan@opensource.osu.edu. So, join the mailing list or check the wiki for info as it is posted and we hope to see you all there…happy gaming!</p>

Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!</p>

One complaint that seems common in the open source OS world is that gaming is pretty much thrown out the window once you have made the switch. We would like to spend the meeting debunking this myth and showing all of the options that one has in the open source gaming arena. We will be showing pure open source games, games that you probably didn’t know ran natively in Linux, and how gaming in <a href="http://www.winehq.org/about/">WINE</a> has improved by leaps and bounds recently and actually does a relatively good job with some of our beloved games that only work on Windows. So come on out and join the discussion and hopefully learn how you are not totally hopeless gaming wise when switching to an open source operating system!</p>

<p>This Meeting is in preparation for our LAN party that we are hosting Saturday, May 22nd! There will be more information provided at the meeting and you can join our <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce">announcement mailing list</a> for up to date information, or check the <a href="/lan">wiki</a>!</p>
