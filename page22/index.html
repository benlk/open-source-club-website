<p>This presentation is going to try and cover a lot of ground, and at variable speed. I am trying to get it into two somewhat logical parts.</p>

<p>First being where I into regex then show its use with sed. Then go into using awk, and finally how to use find.</p>

<p>The second half will try and touch on the rest of the commands, concentrating on grep, xargs, and process management.</p>

<p>I also will leave off with a slide or two of fun one liners, and some bash tricks, that people may find super useful.</p>

We apologize for the short notice, and plan on inquiring into why our room was overbooked without our knowledge.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 1<sup>st</sup>, at 7PM in <s>Dreese Labs 266</s>, Brian Swaney demonstrated how to effectively utilize the open source photo editing suite GIMP.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures. The presentation was therefore interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was encouraged. Questions were also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “what is a layer?” to as advanced as “how do I render lightning bolts?” or anything else you can think of. Comments are enabled, so you can post your ideas ahead of time.</p>

<p>At the meeting, there was a lot of demand for a demonstration of rendering lightning bolts. <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/lightning.xcf">Here</a> is a copy of the example XCF image I generated. I followed <a href="http://www.gimptalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=122#pagecontent">this tutorial</a> up to the point where they changed the colorization, then instead selected/cut out the bolt by color, applied the neon filter, and flattened the bolt. The image with Richard Stallman and Bill Gates was also popular, so you’ll find it <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/stallman-gates.xcf">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those out there who continue to persist that “GIMP is inferior to Photoshop and will never be professional,” well… here is a little something by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/krc453">krc453</a>…</p>

The lightning talk format consists of short talks that focus on a single topic and are typically given by multiple presenters in succession. If you are looking for a lightweight program to get the job done and don’t need a graphical interface, be it checking your mail, downloading torrents, chatting on irc, editing text, or anything else, this is definitely the meeting for you. If you have found a command line program that has grasped your interest, consider coming in and sharing with the rest of the club as we are all looking for the next best thing. A current list of programs that are going to be covered is in a list below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tmux</li>
  <li>screen</li>
  <li>mplayer</li>
  <li>htop</li>
  <li>multitail</li>
  <li>mutt</li>
  <li>pal</li>

A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface. In other words it creates a desktop environment for you to use on your screen. The big two desktop environments are KDE and Gnome, but we are going to discuss some lesser known alternatives to these two. Matt Meinwald will be discussing Fluxbox and XFCE. Dan Thau will be showing DWM, EvilWM and how to operate with no window manager at all. Finally, Alek Rollyson will be showing OpenBox, wmii and Awesome WM. Come join us and learn about some alternative window managers that you can learn about and use!</p>

Dan Thau will be talking about chroot, what chroot is and what chroot is not, as well as give examples for usage and a demo or two. Matt Meinwald will demonstrate Xen, a popular server virtualization system. He will give some background, including the difference between paravirtualization and full machine virtualization, then will show a demo of creating and administering a virtual machine. Alek Rollyson will cover desktop related virtualization tools such as Virtualbox and VMware. He will go over the features of these programs, what systems they support, and how to configure and administer virtual desktops.</p>

Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!</p>
