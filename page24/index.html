In his presentation, Scott gave us a brief overview of who FreeGeek is and what they do, touch upon the hazards of electronic waste, describe how FreeGeek rewards volunteers, and share how they’re advocating Ubuntu Linux to people. After his presentation Scott answered everyone’s questions!

The Logical Volume Manager is a system in the Linux kernel that allows the abstraction of physical data volumes into so called “logical volumes”. For example, with LVM, 3 1TB disks can be combined into a single 3TB linear volume. Alex is going to give a brief overview of how the system works, as well as give a demonstration first hand to show the ins and outs of the system. I hope to see you all there!</p>

We will go over all the pros, cons, features, strengths, setup nuances, requirements, and finally how to pick the perfect distro for your needs. After the overview we will then run through a graphical install of Ubuntu and then a text based install of Debian in order to both show the differences between the distributions and how text and graphical installs differ. Our meeting will be on Thursday October 1st in Dreese Labs room 266 and, as always, the meeting is open to everyone. We especially welcome newcomers to this meeting so we can introduce you to the world of Linux and how to get started! Bring any questions you have and we will be happy to answer. Attached below are the presentation slides from this meeting. There is both an OpenDocument format and a Microsoft Powerpoint format. Enjoy!</p>
