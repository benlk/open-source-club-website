He will be covering how wireless networks work, the several types of encryption available, and other settings that can set to try to protect your network. He will be demonstrating these attacks as well, and he encourages people to bring their laptops if they wish to participate (if your wireless card can not run the available software, he will be providing a sample dump for you to play around with, this will be available at the meeting). Everyone is encouraged to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security.  Michael is am bringing my own equipment for demonstrative purposes and he encourage everyone to participate in the presentation.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to use be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given permission explicitly from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily accessible on the Internet.</p>

<p>We should have pizza available as well.</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome, irrelevant of knowledge or experience with Free/Open Source Software.  Hope to see you there!</p>

That said, the club does not completely die over the summer. Some members have proposed having informal meetings, during the usual time (Thursdays at 7PM). You can stay up to date with these by keeping up with the <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource">discussion mailing list</a> and our <a href="/irc">IRC Channel</a>. Meeting details will be posted both here and on the <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce">announcement list</a> if something specific is planned. In addition, there may be unfinished <a href="/projects">club projects</a>, and some members have <a href="/git">personal projects</a> for which they may appreciate help. As always, for any other kinds of communication, you may use the <a href="https://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/contact">contact form</a>, <a href="/mailinglist">mailing list</a>, or <a href="/irc">IRC channel</a>.</p>

<p>As always the OSU Open Source Club does not condone illegal activities and is not responsible for any misuse of the techniques learned in this meeting. Only experiment on systems you own or are authorized to use for the purpose of testing an exploit.</p>

<p>Come to a hands-on open hardware/open source Arduino microcontroller introduction given by the staff of First Year Engineering (FYE) program with an emphasis on their new lab centered about the “Advance Energy Vehicle (AEV),” controlled, of course, by an Arduino.  FYE will supply computer accounts and breadboards with installed Arduinos, so you can cruise through some simple hands-on examples of controlling motors, servos, acquiring analog data, reading and writing to digital pins, and effectively using interrupts (simpler than you would imagine) with this simple eight bit device.  A Matlab/Arduino interface created by Dr. Campa at Mathworks will be displayed, including a “real-time” data graphing example along with simple servo and motor control.  Some other Arduino related tools, such as the fritzing.org software, will also be displayed and discussed.  A pitch will be given for ideas, and possibly programming help, in simplifying the AEV code as much as possible for students with Matlab, but no C++, background.</p>

The emphasis will be on Free, Open Source games, but people are welcome to play whatever they’d like. Additional details can be found at the <a href="/lan">LAN website</a> as well as a registration form, to help us get a feel for how many people we will have and what games you want to play. Please bring your computer, any game media you might need, as well as a network cable or two, in case some people do not have one. If you have any questions, please send an email to lan@opensource.osu.edu.</p>

If you are interested in running, please email elections@opensource.osu.edu in order to be listed here and in the meeting announcement. Any OSU student who has been to at least one meeting is eligible to run for president, vice president, or treasurer.</p>

<p>The following people have announced their candidacy.</p>

<p>President: Daniel Thau
Vice President: Paul Schwendenman, Brian Swaney (tentative)
Treasurer: Joel Friedly</p>

<p>In addition, Brian Swaney has proposed the following ballot initiative.</p>

<p>With most discussion surrounding ACTA/COCIA/SHIELD and Wikileaks ex post facto legislation died down, the immediate urgency with which it was hastily voted on and posted is alleviated. The senator who introduced the Espionage amendment (SHIELD Act, by John Ensign R-NV) which sparked this movement is also no longer in office, although a key co-sponsor Joe Lieberman I-CT is still in office. Therefore, during the election procedure I believe we should also vote on its removal. While the Open Source Club will continue its endorsement of EFF, it no longer seems necessary to keep extra clutter on our web page. <em>Shall the Ohio State University Open Source Club remove the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s “Say NO to online censorship” button?</em></p>

MAC is a different approach to computer security from the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that is the default for Windows, Macs, most Linux distros, and most other Unixy operating systems. The basic concepts behind MAC will be explained, contrasted against DAC, and various options for MAC on Linux will be covered (with specific focus given to SELinux and TOMOYO Linux). Additionally, a several applications of MAC will be demonstrated, such as locking down xpdf (a Linux pdf reader) with TOMOYO Linux.</p>

These utilities can be useful in their own right, but often can be connected together with pipes to do new and interesting things. It would be helpful if people interested in presenting signed up with their choices, either by emailing me at meinwald.1@osu.edu or commenting below. This way we can avoid duplication. For now assume each talk can be up to 5 minutes, but that is subject to change.</p>

<p>So far the following people have signed up.</p>

<p>Dan Thau: awk, clive, busybox, graft, pwd, whoami
Morgan Goose: netcat, tar, rsync, iperf, tee
Matt Meinwald: curl, wget
Alek Rollyson: tshark, offlineimap, slock, packer, gnupg, rtorrent</p>
