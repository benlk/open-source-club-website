He will show what the software has to offer and will demo the installation process on Debian.  Depending on time and interest, he may explain how we use it in the Open Source club systems or compare it to other software out there.</p>

Despite being known as one of the more difficult VCSs to grasp, git has become quite popular and has a fair number of recognizable F/OSS projects using it, such as the Linux Kernel and X.org. Daniel will cover a quick history of Git (lots of tasty drama), cover some pros and cons of using Git, explain what Git is doing under the hood, give a conceptual explanation of what Git does, and of course go over both basic (add, commit, branch, merge, etc) and advanced (stash, rebase, etc) Git usage. Having a laptop with Git installed may be benficial for those in the audience who want to play along, but those without should be perfectly fine. NOTE: Due to veterans day this meeting is on a Friday, not a Thursday!</p>

A popular architecture for developing web applications, MVCs have come into their own in the past decade becoming the standard for quick deployment of applications. Information, use cases, and examples of MVCs and web applications will be covered.</p>

<p>Also featuring Tubbs witty remarks and dashing good looks, maybe even pizza.</p>

Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read Slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. This may be Alex’s last quarter at Ohio State, so don’t miss this meeting! It should also be noted that award certificates will be given out to those who can show that they’ve received a comment moderated 3 or better within the last week! There will also be candy tossed out for valuable participation in the discussions during the meeting.</p>

It will show you how things can be easier and more fun in Python! I will will be covering things from as simply as handling basic data types to more advance things such as making system calls or making the most of the PSL (Python Standard Library).</p>

<p>This meeting will also attempt to cover a small comparison between the larger more known languages: Java and C++, and show how some things can be done easier and quicker than in Java or C++.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what I am talking about, still stop by and maybe you’ll finally take that small leap into the programming world.</p>

GIMP is what some might consider an open source alternative to the proprietary $800 Photoshop application, except that many people refuse to consider it on the grounds that it is allegedly inferior, and therefore unusable. While I’m not familiar with Photoshop, I will debunk the myth about GIMP being unusable, and show just how powerful GIMP can be for those who take the time to learn it. I’ll do this by teaching you how to perform arbitrary Photoshop-esque techniques in GIMP.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures, so the presentation will be interactive and based on audience feedback. Use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was recommended. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “<em>how do I save as a JPEG</em>” to as advanced as “<em>how do I remove braces?</em>” or anything else you can think of. Asking your questions below in advance will help me to prepare relevant content for you.</p>

<p>While I have some example content, basic to advanced, the talk will be focused on what <em>you</em> want to cover. This can be anything from a quick adjustment of the color/contrast/angle for your pictures, to completely removing a girlfriend/parent/sibling, to <a href="/~swaneybr/images/lightning.xcf">rendering lightning bolts</a>, to making the picture just… <a href="https://box.com/shared/static/qi2ekqlhrupm3bkdnjr3.xcf">lie</a>. By the time you leave, you should qualify as a <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200807020002?f=h_top">Fox News editor</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a time-lapsed example of what GIMP is capable of in the right hands by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/krc453">krc453</a>:</p>

Per Mutt’s mantra, most e-mail clients suck, Mutt just sucks less. Alek will be showcasing Mutt’s capabilities via the story of Mua the Mutt and the adventures in which she partakes. Through a storytelling device, he will explain that Mutt is solely a mail user agent and requires other pieces and parts in order to function as a complete email solution. Once the entire system is complete, the user will have powerful regex capabilities, email threading, offline email access, pgp encryption and signing, sending and receiving from multiple addresses, 256 color inbox sorting, and synching with gmail if one wishes. This meeting will be perfect for those who are scared of Mutt’s complexity, tried Mutt and got frustrated, looking to improve their Mutt setup, or have no idea what Mutt is but want an extremely powerful and 1337 email setup.</p>

It might seem too easy and obvious to bother with in this day and age. We all know how to rip CD’s, collect and share music, and move it to our portables for on-the-go music. My server comes from an audiophile standpoint. Long story short, I used to sell expensive stereo equipment. There are people out there right now spending up to $60,000 on CD players. I’d like to show you how to build your own that competes with these on sound quality, is easier to use, much more fun, has more features, and is completely free. edit: my blog: http://opensourceaudiophile.com/</p>

We will be meeting in the Ohio Union Senate Room (note the change in location from last year) at 7PM. After a short introduction of the club and a brief description of the blood drive we are sponsoring on the 30th, Matt Meinwald will present an overview of Free operating systems, focusing primarily on GNU/Linux distributions. The main software component of a computer is its operating system, and it is good to know we have plenty of Free and Open Source options for this important role. Matt will discuss and demo popular desktop GNU/Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Mandriva, and OpenSuse, then if time remains, will open discussion to anyone who wishes to talk about his/her favorite distribution. As it turned out, most everyone already knew about these topics, so we discussed what the club does and future meeitngs instead of the original topic. <a href="/~paradigm/minutes.html#htoc7">Minutes</a> for this meeting</p>
