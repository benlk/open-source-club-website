The main tool that will be used is Mercurial, however most of what is shown can be applied to many of the other source control management tools. When you are working by yourself on really small programs, like the ones you do in CSE 221,222,321, then you can get away with not using any source control tools. However, real-world projects involve lots of different files and are worked on by many people that are located in different places– and this is why it’s important to understand how to use a source control management tool. As usual the meeting will be at 7:00 pm in Dreese Labs room 266. The meeting is open to anyone who wants to learn about source control management. After the presentation we will try to work on getting a project started since we haven’t done so yet.</p>

Some basic points to be discussed are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is Linux?</li>
  <li>What does Linux do?</li>
  <li>Why is Linux better than Windows (or why not)?</li>
  <li>Who does Linux appeal to?</li>
  <li>What are some of the advantages/disadvantages of using Linux?</li>
  <li>What features does Linux have?</li>
</ul>

<p>If time permits we plan on discussing how one picks a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">Linux distribution</a>, running a LiveCD, and running through the installation procedure, also covering some of the more advanced setups like setting up a computer so it can run both Windows and Linux (with a menu at startup asking which one you want), how to mount directories, and what to do if Windows gobbles up your Master Boot Record (MBR) making Linux unbootable.</p>

See a summary of what I’m presenting below.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Net Neutrality is a principle, that if passed into law would prevent internet service providers from using their control over your internet connection for anything other than serving you.
    <ul>
      <li>It prevents ISPs from blocking/degrading access to competitors’ (or any) websites for commercial or political reasons.</li>
      <li>It prevents ISPs from blocking/degrading/prioritizing services, such as video streaming, VoIP, music downloads, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Net Neutrality is not about restricting free-trade.
    <ul>
      <li>Restrictions imposed on all companies will not create an “unfair advantage” for anyone.</li>
      <li>Restricting or degrading access to smaller-scale sites for political or commercial reasons <u>does</u> create an “unfair advantage”.</li>
      <li>Corporations will not regulate themselves. If their only incentive is money, and dis-servicing a few customers would make them an extra 10%, there is nothing but the law to stop them from it.</li>
      <li>The ISPs own the equipment, but they did not “invent” the internet, nor was the internet created with this in mind.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the most important reason, it is the very first amendment in our Bill of Rights. No media vendor has any place restricting people’s free speech, in the U.S. or anywhere.
        <ul>
          <li>There is no reason for ISPs to start charging website owners - who <em>aren’t even on their network</em> - just so their users are able to access said websites. That’s not a “special service” – it’s extortion for money.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ISPs claim that they can “improve quality” of services and websites by “prioritizing bandwidth” and cite the “congestion” as a dire need of action, and a sign of the “death of the internet”.</li>
  <li>Restricting access to smaller websites, which is against net neutrality, would be the “death of the internet”. Nobody would visit said websites, owners wouldn’t generate enough revenue to continue hosting, and nearly all of the websites currently online would disappear forever by the end of the year.</li>
  <li>The ability to charge incremental subscription rates for “premium bandwidth” would remove the providers’ incentive to fix the problem. They’d instead charge premium providers more and more to degrade other subscribers’ service, just so they can keep said premium providers’ bandwidth at a constant rate.</li>
</ul>

Find a summarized guide for those who aren’t having trouble with their closed-source drivers below.</p>

<p>First, you should have the Gnome Network Manager installed. Most Ubuntu distributions come with this by default, and if it’s installed, you will see an icon something like <img src="/sites/default/files/12_04_icon1.png" alt="" />in the top-right corner of the screen near the date/time. If not, then (from a place where you do have internet access) run:</p>

<p><code>bash
sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
</code></p>

<p>Now that the Network Manager is taken care of, you’ll need to ensure you have your OSU internet username handy. If you haven’t already, set up your account at <a href="https://my.osu.edu/">here</a> (this only applies if you are an incoming freshman/transfer student who does not have a name.# yet). If you forget your password, rather than re-registering, you can recover it at <a href="https://my.osu.edu/public/ResetPassword">my.osu.edu</a>. In the past, your wireless username and password were different from your OSU username and password. This has changed, and once you are enrolled in the Identify Management System the username and password will be the same. If you have a name.#, it may work for a short time but will not work forever.</p>

<p>Now we’re ready to configure your device. Find a place on campus with wireless internet (<a href="http://osuwireless.osu.edu/map.php">map</a>) and click the Network Manager button. Select “osuwireless” from the list. Do <u>not</u> select osuguest or OSUVOICE, as these are off-limits to students. You’ll get a prompt that looks something like this. Make sure all of these fields match up, and fill in your OSU username and password (if you haven’t already signed up at my.osu.edu, this will not yet work for you).</p>

<p><img src="/sites/default/files/network-manager-example.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now fill in your username and password, leaving the rest of the fields blank. (In this case, replace name.# with your OSU username.number.) If your prompt has a field listed as <strong>PEAP Version</strong> select “Version 0”. Anything else should be as shown above or left blank (default).</p>

<p>If you are asked for a CA certificate file, you may (optionally) want to download and use one. Essentially, it’s supposed to help protect you from a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle</a> attack, so if you don’t download it you might get a security warning when you first connect. To do this, you can select the right certificate authority in the prompt by browsing to <code>/etc/ssl/certs/</code> and selecting <code>AddTrust_External_Root.pem</code>. This certificate is included by default in Ubuntu, and after selection network manager should not give you warnings again. If you get another warning about certificate errors after doing this… well, personally I would call shenanigans on the network if I saw that, since it probably means somebody is doing evil stuff to my connection.</p>

<p>Once the fields are filled in as described, hit connect. If you’re within an acceptable range of the wireless access point, you should be able to load your favorite web page within 30 seconds. After you have connected the first time, your computer should automatically connect to osuwireless whenever it’s in range. If you attempted to connect to osuguest, Ubuntu will automatically try to connect to that network, possibly before trying osuwireless, and it won’t get anywhere. You can disable it by removing the “osuguest” folder in <code>~/.gconf/system/networking/wireless/networks/</code> and it will forget it ever tried to connect to osuguest. If you are running Ubuntu 9.04 or higher, you can right-click the <a href="/sites/default/files/wireless-icon.png">wireless icon</a>, select the <a href="/sites/default/files/wireless-tab.png">Wireless tab</a>, and delete it from that list. Same with OSUVOICE.</p>

Meetings end whenever they end, with no specific time.

The meeting was open to students and non-students alike, and pizza was served as always. Altogether we had a great turnout and I look forward to a similar turnout at our next meeting.</p>
