<hr />

<p>also, last week there was a big misunderstanding. I want to make sure that everyone knows the following about our meetings:</p>

<p>They are Discussions.
What does that mean?
- You can speak up at any time for clarification, correction, or otherwise
- If something pans out where the conversation doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, it should be discussed later. (I definitely overreacted when this happened at our last meeting, and I apologize to all)</p>

<p>Let me know if anyone has any questions or clarifications on this. We are a bunch of hackers on equal footing, new members and old. Meetings should reflect this :)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

AWK is an interpreted programming language which excels at text processing and quick-and-dirty one-liners.  It is part of the POSIX standard and will thus be found on just about every unix system, including exceedingly minimal ones.  AWK has a number of relatively unique aspects that can make it quite enjoyable to use - for its target use, an AWK program is often significantly smaller than almost every other language.</p>

In this talk, we will discuss different ways of penetrating wireless access points with the goal of explaining how security works in a wifi world. The takeaway from this is that, once you’re out there, you should be able to protect your wifi as best as possible. This talk is intended to be interactive, which means that there will be an access point on location that we’ll be attempting to gain access to. This talk is also intended to be informative, which means that we’ll be discussing some of the different types of authentication out there in the world. DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given explicit permission from the owner of said equipment. Also we are NOT responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very easily available on the Internet via your favorite search engine. <strong>I reiterate, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DO THIS ON ANY EQUIPMENT YOU DO NOT OWN OR DO NOT HAVE EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION TO DO SO.</strong> In order to get the most from this talk, it helps to come with the software preinstalled. There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz For more information about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/</p>

<p>For more information about aircrack-ng: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC (#osuosc on freenode) and we’ll help you out.</p>
