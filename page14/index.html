This presentation primarily will focus basic tools including but not limited to <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-clone.html">cloning</a>/<a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-heal.html">healing</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-combining.html">layer</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-layer-mask-menu.html">masking</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-using-paths-and-selections.html">fine</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html">selections</a>, and <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-rotate.html">basic</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-scale.html">image</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-crop.html">transformations</a>. To demonstrate that GIMP is on the same playing field as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopextended.html">other proprietary and expensive image editors</a>, some more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s">advanced techniques</a> may also be discussed if time allows. The talk is interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged, but no prior experience with image editors is necessary. Nonetheless, the talk shall be informative for even experienced image editors.</p>

<p>Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.</p>

<p>Finally, the upcoming version of GIMP, and its progress will be discussed. If ready by the presentation, a new version will be demonstrated, and features will be explained. The overall progress of the new stable version will also be discussed, and some even newer features not released in the upcoming version will be demonstrated.</p>

Many of Ohio State’s web-based applications and services rely on this open source project for authentication of students and employees and to obtain information about those users for personalization or limiting access to authorized users.</p>

<p>Shibboleth is primarily based on an open standard called <a href="http://saml.xml.org/">SAML</a> that allows for authentication of users from multiple organizations to services running at different organizations, a security model called “federated identity”. The key benefit to users is the ability to leverage a password or other credentials shared with a trusted site (such as OSU’s login service) to access a variety of other sites without disclosing one’s password to them.</p>

<p>Scott Cantor, the administrator of the OSU web login environment, and a developer on the Shibboleth project for about 10 years, will discuss the project, the SAML standard and federated identity in general, and their future directions. OSU’s various activities in this area will also be discussed.</p>

<p>Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. An open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software. With strong support for integration with other languages, built-in concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Haskell.org</li>
</ul>

<p>Continuing the series on introductory Haskell programming we will talk
about abstractions common to everyday Haskell. This will include I/O and
you should be able to wrap your head around existing code. We didn’t make
it to the abstractions last week, so this week will be somewhat abstract.
Towards the end we should hopefully get something fairly practical
discussed.</p>

<p>For those of you who couldn’t make it last week, we covered most* of the
material up to and including Chapter 8 of Learn You A
Haskell<a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters</a>.
The topics in Chapter 8 will probably receive some attention again before
moving onto the other topics.</p>

<p>The Haskell interpreter (ghci) is a great help in learning how things work.
If you want to follow along Thursday night, you should download the Haskell
Platform for your favorite operating system:
http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/</p>

<p>There is also talk of doing some practical group projects. My suggestion is
going to be to work through some of the exercises in Learn You a Haskell or
Real World Haskell (free online books). If you are interested in this, we
will probably be organizing something like this during the meeting. If you
miss the meeting but would like to be involved, it will likely be a common
discussion topic in the OSC IRC channel.</p>

<p>Following up the craziness from last week’s Introduction to Haskell, I will
be presenting some more advanced stuff. I will begin by reviewing some of
the things from the end of last week’s talk for those who left early or
burned their brain out. I will show you some practical code using only the
tools we’ve learned so far and then some of the abstractions that Haskell
uses.</p>

<p>I’ve recently revamped my Haskell Presentation. It should flow
significantly smoother than its previous incarnations. This will be the
first of a series of Haskell talks. The series should cover a wide breadth
of material at a fairly deep level. This will be the basic introduction to
programming in Haskell.</p>

Daniel will go over the idea behind a DVCS, as well as some of the stuff going on under the hood in one of them (git).  Meisam will continue presenting on git, going over things such as the git commands, config file, hooks, and daemon.  Paul will present on Bazaar, another DVCS.</p>
