With the techniques which will be presented, it is not unusual for laptops to have battery lives that actually outlast manufacturer’s advertised specifications; for example, Daniel’s Lenovo x230 with a 94Wh battery tends to last upwards of 12 hours in real-world conditions.  If you <em>really</em> love your laptop, and want to show it how much you care this Valentine’s day, this presentation will show you how to treat it right.</p>

<p>This Thursday, 2013/02/07 at 7pm in Dreese Labs 369, Hussain Frosh of Harris will be presenting an introduction to development for Android.

<p>We recommend bringing a laptop, as the goal for this presentation is to have all participants set up and comfortable with the development environment for Android.</p>

The presentation will be interactive and encourage audience participation, so you should bring a laptop with GIMP already installed to follow along. Some techniques covered may include <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-clone.html">cloning</a>/<a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-heal.html">healing</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-combining.html">layer</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-layer-mask-menu.html">masking</a>, <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-using-paths-and-selections.html">fine</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html">selections</a>, and <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-rotate.html">basic</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-scale.html">image</a> <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-crop.html">transformations</a>. Some more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s">advanced techniques</a> may be covered if time allows, just to show that GIMP can live up to the same standard as <em>other editors whose names are withheld due to trademark licensing concerns</em>, but no prior experience is required.</p>

<p>Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.</p>

<p>The presentation will use 2.8. If you haven’t installed GIMP yet, make sure you install 2.8, and if you have 2.6 installed, you should upgrade to 2.8 if feasible. Differences between the 2 versions will still be covered where applicable.</p>

He will be covering: what IRC is, what IRC is used for, and most importantly how to interface with IRC. From general observations, it appears that many in the club use IRC and many more would like to participate in the IRC channel <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/osuosc">#osuosc</a> on <a href="https://freenode.net/">freenode</a>. <!--break-->(<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#osuosc">#osuosc webchat</a>) The goal of this talk is to provide information on using IRC in a terminal that is remotely connected a dedicated machine running a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> variant in a way that facilitates easy access and <a href="https://xkcd.com/705/">optimal uptime</a>. While there exist countless IRC clients for countless platforms this talk is going to focus on using IRC from a GNU/Linux machine that is left on 24/7, “dedicated”, so that one can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr></a> into the machine (from Windows, Mac and GNU/Linux) and pull up their session the way they left it. This is often called “idling” and most people on the larger IRC networks often “idle”. The software combination that will be described in detail for this talk is <a href="http://weechat.org/"><abbr title="Wee Enhanced Environment for Chat">WeeChat</abbr></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">tmux</a>. If you would like to follow along, please bring a laptop running a GNU/Linux variant and have a working Internet connection. There will be no slides and this will be a live demonstration of how to set up WeeChat and tmux on the GNU/Linux distribution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</a> 6 “Squeeze”.
<br /><br />
<b>Preparations:</b> You can install tmux through most package managers on most GNU/Linux <a href="http://bedrocklinux.org/">distributions</a>. WeeChat should be downloaded and compiled from source to obtain the latest version, <a href="http://weechat.org/download/stable/">0.4.0</a> (which was released this past Sunday, 2013/01/20). The compilation of WeeChat will briefly be demonstrated.
<br /><br />
<b>Students:</b> The <a href="https://opensource.osu.edu/"><abbr title="The Ohio State University Open Source Club">OSUOSC</abbr></a> offers access to a system designed specifically for “idling”. You must be a student to request access and access can only be given in person. Please contact an officer of the club today for more information!
<br /><br />
<b>Afterwards:</b> There will be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"><abbr title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</abbr></a> signing party after the IRC meeting. If you would like to participate please bring a piece of paper with necessary information to sign your key (full name, e-mail address associated with your key, key ID and/or your key fingerprint, and where to obtain your public key), as we will only be exchanging papers for the signing party. Also, please bring at least one government issued photo identification with you if you would like others to sign your PGP key, individual members may have more strict requirements for signing your PGP key. If you have any questions please feel free to <a href="https://opensource.osu.edu/contact">contact us</a>. Additionally, we will go over how to create a PGP key during this segment.</p>
